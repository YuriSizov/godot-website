		<title>Dev snapshot: Godot 4.0 beta 12</title>
		<link>https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-12/</link>
		<description>We released a massive 4.0 beta 11 on Tuesday, and users found a lot of regressions – as we expected! Contributors fixed many of the new regressions quickly, and we merged another big batch of changes. As the pace intensifies in the lead-up to the first Release Candidate, we decided to make more frequent beta snapshots for testing.</description>

		<title>Dev snapshot: Godot 4.0 beta 11</title>
		<link>https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-11/</link>
		<description>First snapshot of the year, Godot 4.0 beta 11! We took a bit longer to prepare this beta as there were a number of fairly big GDScript refactoring PRs (needed to fix many bugs), which we wanted to merge all at once. As such we expect that this beta 11 might introduce some new GDScript regressions, which we'll aim to fix for beta 12 next week.</description>
